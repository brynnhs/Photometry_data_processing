# Photometry data processing

This processing algorithm of fiber photometry recordings was developed by Ekaterina Martianova in Christophe Proulx lab at CERVO Brain research center, Laval university, Quebec, QC, Canada, 2019.

In order to use, please copy the notebook ___Photometry_data_processing.ipynb___ to your google drive by clicking on [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/katemartian/Photometry_data_processing/blob/master/Photometry_data_processing.ipynb) and the example file example.csv to your google drive and follow the instructions in the notebook. You can also run the codes from your local machine if you would like. For MATLAB version, open ___Photometry_data_processing.mlx___ in MATLAB Live Editor and follow the instructions in the notebook. For R version, open ___Photometry_data_processing.Rmd___ in RStudio and follow the instructions in the notebook.
